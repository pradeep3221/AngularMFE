# Root Folder Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-09-26  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully cleaned up the root directory by removing obsolete and duplicate files that were reorganized into individual project folders and the docs archive folder.

## Files Removed

### Old Dockerfiles (Previously moved to project folders)
- ✅ `Dockerfile.shell` → Now at `projects/shell/Dockerfile`
- ✅ `Dockerfile.mfe1` → Now at `projects/mfe1-dashboard/Dockerfile`
- ✅ `Dockerfile.mfe2` → Now at `projects/mfe2-user-management/Dockerfile`
- ✅ `Dockerfile.mfe3` → Now at `projects/mfe3-auth/Dockerfile`

### Configuration Files (Archived as backups)
- ✅ `nginx.conf` → Archived as `docs/archived/nginx.conf.backup`
- ✅ `ngsw-config.json` → Archived as `docs/archived/ngsw-config.json.backup`

**Note:** While individual projects have their own `nginx.conf`, the original root versions are kept as reference in the archive folder.

### Temporary Generation Scripts
- ✅ `generate-icons.html` - Removed (one-time PWA icon generation utility)
- ✅ `generate-pwa-icons.js` - Removed (one-time PWA icon generation utility)
- ✅ `setup-pwa.sh` - Removed (one-time PWA setup script)

### Obsolete Documentation
- ✅ `PWA_INSTALL_GUIDE.md` - Removed (superseded by `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)
- ✅ `PWA_INSTALL_ICON_GUIDE.md` - Removed (superseded by `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)
- ✅ `Tasks_2025-09-26T04-20-12.md` - Removed (old task tracking file)

## Files Kept in Root

### Essential Configuration
- `angular.json` - Monorepo workspace configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript root configuration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency lock file
- `.editorconfig` - Editor configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `.dockerignore` - Docker build ignore rules (kept as reference for root-level Docker builds if needed)

### Orchestration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration (updated with project folder paths ✓)

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick lookup guide (current)
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Detailed project structure documentation
- `REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Reorganization documentation
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Development
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint configuration
- `cypress.config.ts` - E2E test configuration

### Directories
- `.angular/` - Angular build cache
- `.git/` - Git repository
- `.vscode/` - VS Code settings
- `cypress/` - E2E tests
- `docs/` - Documentation (includes new `archived/` folder)
- `projects/` - Monorepo projects (shell, mfe1, mfe2, mfe3, shared)

## Cleanup Results

### Before
- 37 files/directories in root (including temporary files)
- Duplicate nginx.conf and ngsw-config.json in both root and projects/
- Temporary generation scripts still present
- Old documentation files causing confusion

### After
- 18 essential files/directories in root (54% reduction)
- All Dockerfiles organized in project folders
- Reference configs archived for future use
- Clean documentation with single source of truth
- Only current, maintained files in root

## Next Steps for Developers

1. **Reference Files:** If you need to check or update nginx.conf or ngsw-config.json templates, they're available in `docs/archived/`

2. **Docker Builds:** All Dockerfiles are now in their respective project folders:
   - `projects/shell/Dockerfile`
   - `projects/mfe1-dashboard/Dockerfile`
   - `projects/mfe2-user-management/Dockerfile`
   - `projects/mfe3-auth/Dockerfile`

3. **Quick Start:** Refer to `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for common commands and file locations

4. **Project Structure:** See `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for detailed organization explanation

## Verification

✅ All old Dockerfiles removed from root  
✅ Reference configs archived to `docs/archived/`  
✅ Temporary scripts removed  
✅ Obsolete documentation removed  
✅ Root folder now contains only essential files  
✅ `docker-compose.yml` updated with new paths ✓  
✅ Individual project Dockerfiles have correct COPY paths ✓

## Impact on Operations

- **No impact on functionality** - All files relocated with references updated
- **Build process unchanged** - `docker-compose.yml` correctly references new paths
- **Development workflow unchanged** - `npm` scripts and project structure intact
- **Cleaner repository** - Easier to navigate and maintain
- **Better organization** - Related files grouped with their projects

**Project Status:** ✅ Root folder cleanup complete. All projects organized and ready for development.
